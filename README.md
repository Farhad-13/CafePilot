# CafePilot
CafePilot is a simple and intuitive coffee shop management system designed for tracking orders, managing the menu, and overseeing inventory. With CafePilot, users can easily add or remove menu items, process customer orders, calculate totals, and maintain inventory records efficiently.

This project is a practice assignment for my Python programming course, designed by me as the instructor. Students will use this project to reinforce the concepts they have learned and become familiar with applying these concepts in real-world scenarios.
